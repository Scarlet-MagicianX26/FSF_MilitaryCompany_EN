aEP_DuiLiu,SHIP,"The ship, which only recently appeared in Perseus, is a symbol of the company's power and is a new face compared to the many experienced designs in the field. The main ship used by the FSF for a long time was the Pacesetter-Class designed in the days of the Domain of Man, but the FSF, since becoming a force in the Sector, needed a warship designed for itself, so the Thermocline-class was born. Neither heavily armoured nor fast; but with its densely packed weapon slots, if you can seize the moment, you can destroy the opponent with pure projection of power. This battleship will represent the FSF against rivals of its class in the galaxy.
The Thermocline symbolizes drastic changes in a short period of time, and its design without large slots makes weaker a conventional drawn-out gun battle, but in the hands of a brave captain, it can win battles without engaging in lengthy exchanges, and it is those who are convinced they will win in a narrow encounter that will gain the favor of the goddess of victory.
",,,;
aEP_NuanChi,SHIP,"Seemingly looking like an asteroid factory with engines and armor bolted onto it, the Warmpool-Class certainly fits the missile mainship designation. The cost of scaling up a miniature missile factory to full size is great; not only is the space redundancy for extended launcher modifications squeezed dry, but the frequency of missile launches suffers as well. But with increased time in the field, the full-size missile factory's steady stream of missile regeneration can make it prove its worth. Unlike its cluttered appearance, the Warmpool-Class takes full account of the need for impact mitigation and damage control in its hull structure and stores its munitions evenly, giving it not only good armor but also a near zero chance of overall destruction in the event of damage.

The haphazard layout of the Nuanchi class was also designed to accommodate the ""Reflash"" Ammunition Supply shipsystem, a loading device that uses standardized feeding modules to quickly feed ammunition from all parts of the ship to the missile launchers. This system supports continuous use when sufficient energy was available, allowing the Warmpool class to produce a terrific amount of launches in a short period of time. When the Warmpool class was officially commisioned, the mainstream view was that it was a bold expansion of the Gryphon-Class. Such a missile ship is a feared existence at all times, but it does not show the firepower that matches the number of missile slots. Then again, perhaps, the  people who have seen such a display of firepower no longer exist.",,,
aEP_BiaoBing,SHIP,"If the Paragon is the product of a mixture of the delusions of the senior admirals and the ambitions of the top brass of Tri-Tachyon, the Pacesetter is a solid step towards the energization of battleships. Unlike the Paragon-Class, which uses an advanced targeting core at no cost, the Javelin class uses a separate firing support radar designed to address the lack of energy weapon range. In order to bear the strain of this system, the Pacesetter-Class sacrificed much of its armor as a battleship in exchange for excellent, if not superior maneuverability, which, combined with the luxurious weapon slot configuration throughout the body, can cause terrifying pressure on the enemy in a single short burst.

Despite the huge sacrifices made, the Javelin class substantially cannot afford to keep its radar on at full power for long periods of time, which means that in a one-on-one encounter, most conventional live-fire battleships can easily suppress the Javelin class if they can maintain a superior range. The Javelin class is more like a return to the old days of traditional battleships, simple and practical, than the energy battleships that use advanced targeting cores that require a lot of highly skilled personnel to maintain. The Javelin should not have appeared in the Persean Sector, because neither the previously stationed battlegroup nor the XIV Battlegroup that came for rotation were equipped with the Pacesetter-Class, but the ship still appeared in the FSF Corporation's cargo list in an enigmatic way. Excluding the various additional rumors, one thing is certain, the founding fathers of FSF must have had close ties with certain executives before the Collapse and were able to get prototypes of various equipment under test.
",,,;
aEP_NeiBo,SHIP,"A battlecruiser built to hunt small ships, unlike most of the company's fleet which have slower characteristics and a focus on heavy firepower. The Internalwave employs a pulse burst propulsion system once used on strikecraft that can propel the giant in an instant. Another unique design is the turret module attached to the main gun, which has independent weapon and flux management systems, greatly reducing the pressure on the mothership's flux management. Although classified as a battlecruiser, its armor and structure are slightly higher than the company's battleships, making the Internalwave a slightly awkward design. As an alternative design of line ship, a large number of small slots are not conducive to taking damage, and it is easy to fall into a 'no guns available' scenario in an evenly matched battle, while on the other hand, the huge damage of the main gun is extremely dangerous towards small and medium-sized ships, which puts the captain's ability to select opponents to the test. In order to mitigate the effects of damage to the weapon slots, a modular armor is arranged on the bow, a move that increases frontal capability to a limited extent, but once this armor is disengaged, it is recommended that the Internalwave avoid combat with any warships of the same hull size.",,,;
aEP_ShangShengLiu,SHIP,"A heavy armored freighter only considered when the most dangerous routes are involved, the Upstream-Class, with armor and structure of no lesser quality than most battleships, is able to ignore most threats in the Sector. As the star of the special transport industry, it should never be treated as a mere cargo ship, considering its support systems, which can deploy additional armor to withstand massive damage until reinforcements arrive.

Relative to its supply needs, the maintenance of this folding armor requires more effort than imagined. But in consideration against the threat profiles of the most turbulent areas of the sector, its not that big of a deal.",,,;
aEP_ShangShengLiu_mk2,SHIP,"The modified Upstream-Class, the work of retired FSF designers, removes the telescopic external armor and arranged a series of gun galleries and auxiliary engines in the area of the original cargo hold.

The Upstream-Class has rarely been the target of pirate attacks, much less a successful victim, with only a few documented losses since its inception, and there is some untold story behind the appearance of this ship. Apparently, someone took a Upstream and found a retired designer to build this large iron block that was as close to an official modification as one could be. ",,,;
aEP_ShangShengLiu_mk3,SHIP,"A modification based on the Upstream-Ckass for transporting antimatter fuel. Statistically, in the business field of special fuel transport, the risk reduction from minimizing exposure to high-risk areas is far better than a slapping on a few more layers of armor, but the MK.III chose to do both. It is supported by a giant engine made up of multiple large engines connected in parallel, exceeding any conventional option in size and fuel consumption. After a long acceleration phase, it can traverse the battlefield at speeds that destroyers can't even hope to match.

The fuel needed to operate this monster engine comes directly from the cargo of the MK.III, making its actual effective capacity lower than the marked value. Although it may have consumed half of its cargo while crossing dangerous area, its arrival with what cargo remains would be considered a success.",,,;
,,,,,
aEP_HaiLiang,SHIP,"This cruiser, built similar to fire support platform of the space station, is designed as a kind of suppression warship. In order to complete the suppression of a large number of small ships, the Seaweight-Class has large slots in each direction to provide range and firepower advantages, and thus does not encounter the problem of facing multiple enemies in different directions with a single turret.  In the suppression mission, the relatively unimportant aspect of maneuverability and frontal capability is sacrificed. Few forces in the Sector have ordered this kind of warship, mainly because they generally have their own warships for these sort of specialist tasks, but a few marginal planets will order a small number to counter the use of high-speed ships for raids by small pirate groups.
",,,
aEP_ZhongLiu,SHIP,"The mainstay of the FSF fleet, the Midstream-Class was designed as a conventional cruiser made to make the best out of the company's strengths. Only slightly more protected than a typical light cruiser the Nakuru lacks the all-important manoeuvrability that makes it such an easy target to destroy, but when built up to a certain size and sharing the pressure with other ships, the Nakuru can quickly destroy any ship with a wide angle and overlapping slots.

The Midstream's powerful slot design combined with its extra range gives it a mainline level of gunnery capability, and protecting their vulnerability is the key to victory in a battle. The Midstream was one of the later designs to enter service in the FSF's fleet and as such represents the maturing of the Company's homemade designs.",,,
aEP_ReQuan,SHIP,"A light missile ship based on the hull of the Sidestrike class, it retains its built-in missile factories as a lighter version of the Warmpool class. Designed with a focus on ease of production, the Hot Spring class has only a limited number of slots for self-defence weapons, meaning that it can easily be taken out by any ship - even a frigate - that rushes into its vicinity. But even with its many drawbacks, its low deployment cost is reason enough for fleet commanders to favour it.",,,
aEP_ZhuanZhu,SHIP,"An indigenously designed gunnery cruiser, armed with a giant Gauss Cannon with an experimental weapon switching system, taking reference from the design of the Dominator class and possessing excellent frontal firepower, possessing a range advantage that cannot be understimated. This practice of building too much of the ship's firepower into the hull was much criticised by ship designers, who claimed that it greatly reduced the ship's versatility and made it difficult to tailor it for specific missions, but that complaint is often rebuked by the sheer firepower that it provides.

aEP_YangJi,SHIP,"A warship stuffed with guns on both sides and a classic FSF export model, it has a good balance of firepower and manoeuvrability, with a built in AA system giving it an additional layer of survivability.

aEP_LiAnLiu,SHIP,"The company's general purpose high-speed destroyer, with three back-mounted turrets on the centre line, provides this warship with a wide range of firepower options. Not only that, but the ship's level of protection has not been sacrificed too much, making it suitable for a wide range of cruising missions, always on the front line of the Company's conflicts, and a staple export model. Despite the limited dispersion, the tactical system allows for a good amount of firepower at short notice by dropping shields.",,,;
aEP_CengLiu,SHIP,"A heavy destroyer providing fire support. Fitting the weapon re-invigoration system to medium to large ships is a difficult process, as the larger the ship is the more pressure it puts on the buffer zone, thus requiring a significant portion of the core hull to be reinforced with bulkheads. This was all to boost the limited firepower boost; as such deploying a destroyer of this type required a fairly strict adherence to certain tactical regulations, rending it useless in untrained hands.",,,
aEP_YouJiYan,SHIP,"The Organic Salt series represents the Company's excellent armoured freighter/tanker options, fitted with armour that would make most destroyers ashamed of themselves, and a flight deck to deal with the threat of high speed targets, but maintaining and deploying it is no less expensive than a proper military destroyer. There is never a shortage of people willing to put a premium on their cargo in the Sector, but in this era passive defence can only a delaying tactic, thus its real value lies in being able to eliminate 'accidents'.

aEP_decomposer,SHIP,"One of the FSF's newest ship developments following the Collapse, the Decomposer-Class carried a significant amount of fuel and supplies, along with an open deck and dismantling system. It was designed to serve the needs of long-range fleets without supplies by dismantling the surviving wreckage of ships on the battlefield to recover needed parts and various consumables. For armies with less than stellar logistical systems, having this type of ship greatly reduces the pressure on logistics and allows an elite fleet to sustain itself for a considerable period of time in the event of a supply failure.
When a ship is shut down in battle, if the hull does not break apart on the spot, a significant part of its interior can be recovered. Normally, it is not until the battle is won or lost that one side is given the authority to clean up the battlefield, by which time many of the items in the wreckage that need to be kept airtight have drifted out into space in a fragmented manner and cannot be recovered. The Decomposer-class, which can conduct its salvage operations even on the battlefield, has a large exposed operations deck with a hole in the middle leading to the inner deck, where its supporting drones have built-in disintegration beams that can precisely break the wreckage into appropriately sized pieces to be carried back to the operations deck for recovery of usable items. To cater for undisturbed operations, the Decomposer has enough firepower to repel smaller ships, making a jack-of-all-trades sufficient to form the core of a small fleet.
Although the armour and structure are of military grade material, the Decomposer sacrifices the space of the shield generator in favour of a built in fleet of shield drones to protect against damage in order to meet the demands of both cargo and disassembly operations.

aEP_FanChongLi,SHIP,"The FSF has developed a frigate equivalent to the Brawler-Class Gunship, with a greater emphasis on defensive capabilities. Although the manoeuvrability, like that of the Brawler, is in the lower middle of the frigate class, the better width, the better shield effect and the unique recoil cannon give the Repulsor class the ability to disengage at any time, designed not to gain an advantage in battle, but to buy time for its own forces  as possible. For a frigate of this medium to large size, the slot design of the Repulsor class was very constrained, meaning that a trade-off had to be made between firepower and defensive power.
The recoil cannon built into the hull of the Repulsor class frigate is a unique tactical system for this ship, similar in principle to the door-breaking cone torpedoes produced by FSF, using a gravitational field generator to camouflage the mass of the projectile, the difference being that this camouflage occurs prior to firing and the ship uses an ultra-high powered electromagnetic chemical hybrid launcher to fire the projectile, already camouflaged as a high mass object, to obtain an equal amount of reaction force to push the the ship backwards rapidly. The gravitational field of the fired shell works at a much higher power than that of a normal breaching cone torpedo and is quickly damaged after launch, although this gives the same strong thrust to the target before the gravitational field inside the shell is completely disabled by a shell hit at close range.
",,,
aEP_XiLiu,SHIP,"A frigate designed according to a rather old layout. The four-way slot is more of a deterrent than anything else, it is the most conventional of the FSF frigates, although it lacks all the striking features that make the Hiryu class famous for its cheap firepower through its quantity of weapons. By streamlining the number of weapons to improve quality, the captain's piloting skills are made more demanding while also significantly raising the ship's performance ceiling.",,,

aEP_RaoLiu,SHIP,"Designed as a scout, the frigate is known for its low price and survival rate that does not match its price. The Recoil class is a frigate that combines high speed with a damping shell, with most of the spaces on the hull suitable for weapons being taken up by armour and damping equipment, making its slot utilisation awkward and its lack of firepower and over-protection making it one of the least popular frigates for pirates in the star realm.

In order to maintain range, the rifling pressure, barrel length and barrel wall thickness of the projectile were greatly increased, while the mass of the warhead was reduced. At the cost of this, the direct impact of the projectile was not worth much against the heavy armour, and too much powder gas was ejected from the muzzle of the gun to form a cloud of smoke when fired. Although the smoke did not affect the performance of the fire control system in any way, it left a mark on the hull, which was much criticised by clean-loving captains.

The warhead contains a set of gravitational field generators that alters the payload's own weight so that the warhead contains far more kinetic energy than its weight, though these sophisticated instruments are sacrificed upon impact.
The torpedo uses a physics-defying gravitational field generator, whose mass in normal conditions can be accelerated to sufficient speed using conventional propulsion systems, and after gaining sufficient velocity the gravitational field activates. This allows a longer range than a normal torpedo, while the kinetic energy impact on a successful hit on the enemy shield would be fatal. Note that its effect is immediately lost in the event of damage to internal parts caused by a rigid impact on the casing. What remains is an impact exceeding some of its counterparts.

aEP_as_large,WEAPON,"A terrifyingly high yield anti-ship missile for the total destruction of enemy capital ships. Works on the same principle as its medium-sized version, but the bulkier hull limits its speed and steering capability.",,,
aEP_flux_tube,WEAPON,"This auxilliary equipment is just another example of the development cycle, as ships that have long since left the era of needing their own heat sink have ended up utilizing this means of direct discharge through a material carrier in order to obtain better flux dispersion. Each flux tube is a simplified version of the ship's flux systems, with space previously used for the missile magazine, targeting and other systems has been modified to channel flux from the hull. This mechanism requires a period of preparation before launch.",,,
aEP_harpoon_large,WEAPON,"A heavy-lined anti-shield missile with a large hull and a large thrust engine, capable of impacting targets at high quality velocities and posing a threat to even moderate armour. Launched at high muzzle velocity and accelerated throughout, it is mounted on the side of the ship and can arc around the frontal point of the target's defence.",,,
aEP_CM_weapon,WEAPON,"The S-1 Cruise Missile is a special missile that uses the hull of a frigate for long range flights, and when the warhead detonates the large amount of shrapnel built into it is melted into plasma and scattered around, heated to temperatures strong enough to melt most armour.",,,;

aEP_long_barrel_chaingunAP,WEAPON,"The placement of a high-density miniature battery in the warhead completely takes away the penetrating power of the bullet, but brings with it a destabilising effect on the shield. Pumping energy into the shield after hitting it sends ripples through the generated defensive surface, significantly increasing the difficulty of maintaining it. -""Don't worry, you won't be electrocuted to paste just because you dropped the case to the ground by mistake.""",-Proceeding of the FSF Advanced Weapons Program Scientists,,

aEP_gunship_drone,SHIP,"The ultimate in interceptor design, with a large number of machine gun turrets with a wide field of fire, using EMP rounds to paralyse the opponent before the main beam cannon in the middle deals a devastating blow. This unforgiving design against fighters has earned its reputation among pilots. Although the lack of sustained armour-breaking capability and low speed dictate that it is very awkward for anti-ship attacks.",,,
aEP_attacker_drone,SHIP,"A heavy attack aircraft, its light frame gives it excellent manoeuvrability and it uses warship-level weaponry to attack its targets.

aEP_FSF,FACTION,"Fast, Safe, Functional aka FSF Corporation is a military corporation founded after the Collapse to sell arms and OEM ships. Its founding dates back to a pre-Collapse powerful smuggling ring, with ties to many of the equipment testing units of the Domain of Man, selling prototypes to various corporations at high prices. With the failure of the Gates, the upper echelons of the syndicate were trapped in a secret warehouse in Perseus. Knowing that the power at their disposal was far from sufficient to protect the precious cargo in the warehouse, they relied on the mountains of supplies in the warehouse to completely disappear from the Starfield dispute and set up the FSF predecessor as an underground organisation.

For quite some time, taking advantage of the chaos at the beginning of the Collapse, they secretly drew Perseus' shocked scientists into the organisation in order to be able to produce copies of the most advanced batch of prototype ships in the FSF's hands at the time, but nothing more was heard of them until the First AI War.

In the golden age after the First AI War, the sporadic appearance of foreign trade warships that people had never seen before in the defence of the Edge World colonies symbolised the FSF's emergence on the Perseus scene as the giant corporation known today for providing, among other things, shipbuilding, military instruction, and weapons trade. Although they have always been a mega-corporation following the laws of the Hegemony throughout the Sector, in recent years their fleet numbers have risen steeply to show their ambition.",,,
aEP_FSF_Relay,CUSTOM,"The location of this communications repeater is very unusual, and the model is not a common Perseus standard model, but instead it's power and clarity of the repeater suggest that it must be a Domain artifact. The FSF must have dragged it from elsewhere (or from its own depot) and fixed it in planetary orbit.",,,
aEP_FSF_SaleStation,CUSTOM,This is the external business centre of FSF Corporation and the orbital facility where FSF was first established. It was chosen in a resource-poor and empty system and has grown over the years to become a commercial hub for people and an armed interstellar fortress.,,,
aEP_FSF_DefStation,CUSTOM,"The FSF's newly constructed military base in the centre of the system, its presence symbolises a change in corporate policy. Although the FSF had been strong enough to defend itself many years ago, it did not maintain a larger military. The completion of this military base signifies the completion of its transformation into a militarised organisation.",,,
aEP_FSF_Homestar,PLANET,"A brown dwarf whose faint nature makes observation difficult. Apart from this, perhaps the only way to describe this system is impoverished, with a lack of exploitable planets and not even an asteroid belt.",,,
aEP_FSF_Homeplanet,PLANET,"If the planet had been closer to its star it would have been a planet with a habitable temperature, but unfortunately now it is a barren place with long days and nights, permanently covered in ice and snow, where even fully dressed protective equipment would not allow one to stay for too long, and it would be rather unwise to set up a permanent settlement when it would consume so many resources. Its most striking features are the huge facilities on the surface and the grand entrance. It is not known whether the company's facilities planetside was built before or after the Collapse, given that it did not exist before the First AI War, but what is confirmed is that it existed before the First AI War and was gradually abandoned afterwards, with its main function shifting to an orbital space station. Perhaps the planet's harsh climate had become an increasingly serious problem as the company's operations expanded.",,,
aEP_FSF_Companyplanet,PLANET,"A typically barren planet, with minerals of some value, but also so close to the star that it is extremely expensive to mine, around which the FSF Corporation has built a new military base, as a fully functional fortress that can withstand stellar radiation for long periods of time is indeed a difficult target on a battlefield close to the star, which perhaps explains why the FSF is willing to spend huge amounts of money here.",,,
aEP_IND_Homestar,PLANET,"The red dwarf does not emit enough heat to support any of the planets at the right temperature, and the cold grips the system. The dimness of light makes any work in this system difficult, and poses a tricky piracy problem.",,,
aEP_IND_Homeplanet,PLANET,"The only way the names of most of the fringe colonies are known today is on a sign at some technological dig site. In an age of chaos when the sector was in a tizzy over resources, most of these untouched places were dead in ten or twenty years.

The temperature on Lamdor X was constantly below the working limit of most equipment, and within two to three years of losing its energy supply most of the population had been lost, except for the city where the spaceport was located, which survived on an antimatter furnace capable of operating for centuries - and on what was left of other lifeless gatherings - until connections with the rest of the sector were re-established.

In light of the previous tragedies on the planet, ""distant relatives are better than close neighbours"" became the principle of diplomacy for most of the local governments, and a very deep defence partnership with the FSF was established from early on, with personnel and equipment exchanged very frequently indeed, despite the insistence of each side on the independence of the other.",,,

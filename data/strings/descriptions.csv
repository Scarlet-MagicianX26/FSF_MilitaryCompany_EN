aEP_DuiLiu,SHIP,"The ship, which only recently appeared in Perseus, is a symbol of the company's power and is a new face compared to the many experienced designs in the field. The main ship used by the FSF for a long time was the Pacesetter-Class designed in the days of the Domain of Man, but the FSF, since becoming a force in the Sector, needed a warship designed for itself, so the Thermocline-class was born. Neither heavily armoured nor fast; but with its densely packed weapon slots, if you can seize the moment, you can destroy the opponent with pure projection of power. This battleship will represent the FSF against rivals of its class in the galaxy.
The Thermocline symbolizes drastic changes in a short period of time, and its design without large slots makes weaker a conventional drawn-out gun battle, but in the hands of a brave captain, it can win battles without engaging in lengthy exchanges, and it is those who are convinced they will win in a narrow encounter that will gain the favor of the goddess of victory.
",,,;
aEP_NuanChi,SHIP,"Seemingly looking like an asteroid factory with engines and armor bolted onto it, the Warmpool-Class certainly fits the missile mainship designation. The cost of scaling up a miniature missile factory to full size is great; not only is the space redundancy for extended launcher modifications squeezed dry, but the frequency of missile launches suffers as well. But with increased time in the field, the full-size missile factory's steady stream of missile regeneration can make it prove its worth. Unlike its cluttered appearance, the Warmpool-Class takes full account of the need for impact mitigation and damage control in its hull structure and stores its munitions evenly, giving it not only good armor but also a near zero chance of overall destruction in the event of damage.

The haphazard layout of the Nuanchi class was also designed to accommodate the ""Reflash"" Ammunition Supply shipsystem, a loading device that uses standardized feeding modules to quickly feed ammunition from all parts of the ship to the missile launchers. This system supports continuous use when sufficient energy was available, allowing the Warmpool class to produce a terrific amount of launches in a short period of time. When the Warmpool class was officially commisioned, the mainstream view was that it was a bold expansion of the Gryphon-Class. Such a missile ship is a feared existence at all times, but it does not show the firepower that matches the number of missile slots. Then again, perhaps, the  people who have seen such a display of firepower no longer exist.",,,
aEP_BiaoBing,SHIP,"If the Paragon is the product of a mixture of the delusions of the senior admirals and the ambitions of the top brass of Tri-Tachyon, the Pacesetter is a solid step towards the energization of battleships. Unlike the Paragon-Class, which uses an advanced targeting core at no cost, the Javelin class uses a separate firing support radar designed to address the lack of energy weapon range. In order to bear the strain of this system, the Pacesetter-Class sacrificed much of its armor as a battleship in exchange for excellent, if not superior maneuverability, which, combined with the luxurious weapon slot configuration throughout the body, can cause terrifying pressure on the enemy in a single short burst.

Despite the huge sacrifices made, the Javelin class substantially cannot afford to keep its radar on at full power for long periods of time, which means that in a one-on-one encounter, most conventional live-fire battleships can easily suppress the Javelin class if they can maintain a superior range. The Javelin class is more like a return to the old days of traditional battleships, simple and practical, than the energy battleships that use advanced targeting cores that require a lot of highly skilled personnel to maintain. The Javelin should not have appeared in the Persean Sector, because neither the previously stationed battlegroup nor the XIV Battlegroup that came for rotation were equipped with the Pacesetter-Class, but the ship still appeared in the FSF Corporation's cargo list in an enigmatic way. Excluding the various additional rumors, one thing is certain, the founding fathers of FSF must have had close ties with certain executives before the Collapse and were able to get prototypes of various equipment under test.
",,,;
aEP_NeiBo,SHIP,"A battlecruiser built to hunt small ships, unlike most of the company's fleet which have slower characteristics and a focus on heavy firepower. The Internalwave employs a pulse burst propulsion system once used on strikecraft that can propel the giant in an instant. Another unique design is the turret module attached to the main gun, which has independent weapon and flux management systems, greatly reducing the pressure on the mothership's flux management. Although classified as a battlecruiser, its armor and structure are slightly higher than the company's battleships, making the Internalwave a slightly awkward design. As an alternative design of line ship, a large number of small slots are not conducive to taking damage, and it is easy to fall into a 'no guns available' scenario in an evenly matched battle, while on the other hand, the huge damage of the main gun is extremely dangerous towards small and medium-sized ships, which puts the captain's ability to select opponents to the test. In order to mitigate the effects of damage to the weapon slots, a modular armor is arranged on the bow, a move that increases frontal capability to a limited extent, but once this armor is disengaged, it is recommended that the Internalwave avoid combat with any warships of the same hull size.",,,;
aEP_ShangShengLiu,SHIP,"A heavy armored freighter only considered when the most dangerous routes are involved, the Upstream-Class, with armor and structure of no lesser quality than most battleships, is able to ignore most threats in the Sector. As the star of the special transport industry, it should never be treated as a mere cargo ship, considering its support systems, which can deploy additional armor to withstand massive damage until reinforcements arrive.

Relative to its supply needs, the maintenance of this folding armor requires more effort than imagined. But in consideration against the threat profiles of the most turbulent areas of the sector, its not that big of a deal.",,,;
aEP_ShangShengLiu_mk2,SHIP,"The modified Upstream-Class, the work of retired FSF designers, removes the telescopic external armor and arranged a series of gun galleries and auxiliary engines in the area of the original cargo hold.

The Upstream-Class has rarely been the target of pirate attacks, much less a successful victim, with only a few documented losses since its inception, and there is some untold story behind the appearance of this ship. Apparently, someone took a Upstream and found a retired designer to build this large iron block that was as close to an official modification as one could be. ",,,;
aEP_ShangShengLiu_mk3,SHIP,"A modification based on the Upstream-Ckass for transporting antimatter fuel. Statistically, in the business field of special fuel transport, the risk reduction from minimizing exposure to high-risk areas is far better than a slapping on a few more layers of armor, but the MK.III chose to do both. It is supported by a giant engine made up of multiple large engines connected in parallel, exceeding any conventional option in size and fuel consumption. After a long acceleration phase, it can traverse the battlefield at speeds that destroyers can't even hope to match.

The fuel needed to operate this monster engine comes directly from the cargo of the MK.III, making its actual effective capacity lower than the marked value. Although it may have consumed half of its cargo while crossing dangerous area, its arrival with what cargo remains would be considered a success.",,,;
,,,,,
aEP_HaiLiang,SHIP,"This cruiser, built similar to fire support platform of the space station, is designed as a kind of suppression warship. In order to complete the suppression of a large number of small ships, the Seaweight-Class has large slots in each direction to provide range and firepower advantages, and thus does not encounter the problem of facing multiple enemies in different directions with a single turret.  In the suppression mission, the relatively unimportant aspect of maneuverability and frontal capability is sacrificed. Few forces in the Sector have ordered this kind of warship, mainly because they generally have their own warships for these sort of specialist tasks, but a few marginal planets will order a small number to counter the use of high-speed ships for raids by small pirate groups.
",,,
aEP_ZhongLiu,SHIP,"The mainstay of the FSF fleet, the Midstream-Class was designed as a conventional cruiser made to make the best out of the company's strengths. Only slightly more protected than a typical light cruiser the Nakuru lacks the all-important manoeuvrability that makes it such an easy target to destroy, but when built up to a certain size and sharing the pressure with other ships, the Nakuru can quickly destroy any ship with a wide angle and overlapping slots.

The Midstream's powerful slot design combined with its extra range gives it a mainline level of gunnery capability, and protecting their vulnerability is the key to victory in a battle. The Midstream was one of the later designs to enter service in the FSF's fleet and as such represents the maturing of the Company's homemade designs.",,,
aEP_ReQuan,SHIP,"A light missile ship based on the hull of the Sidestrike class, it retains its built-in missile factories as a lighter version of the Warmpool class. Designed with a focus on ease of production, the Hot Spring class has only a limited number of slots for self-defence weapons, meaning that it can easily be taken out by any ship - even a frigate - that rushes into its vicinity. But even with its many drawbacks, its low deployment cost is reason enough for fleet commanders to favour it.",,,
aEP_ZhuanZhu,SHIP,"An indigenously designed gunnery cruiser, armed with a giant Gauss Cannon with an experimental weapon switching system, taking reference from the design of the Dominator class and possessing excellent frontal firepower, possessing a range advantage that cannot be understimated. This practice of building too much of the ship's firepower into the hull was much criticised by ship designers, who claimed that it greatly reduced the ship's versatility and made it difficult to tailor it for specific missions, but that complaint is often rebuked by the sheer firepower that it provides.

aEP_ShanHu,SHIP,"A support carrier, as part of the enhancement of the company's fleet aviation capabilities, in its initial version was much superior in maximum speed and deployment consumption.

aEP_ShenCeng,SHIP,"The design is stretches the limit of what a typical missile destroyer is, featuring a large missile and flight deck in a light cruiser package, leaving the Deeplayer-Class with no room for weapons other than a few point defence slots.

aEP_ShenCeng_mk2,SHIP,"A prototype of the Deeplayer-Class Heavy Missile Destroyer, a carrier designed to transport and launch cruiser missiles, carrying only the necessary point defence slots to combat environments - which explains why such a large hull is equipped with only destroyer-class subsystems, as it originally existed as a pure carrier.",,,;
aEP_YangJi,SHIP,"A warship stuffed with guns on both sides and a classic FSF export model, it has a good balance of firepower and manoeuvrability, with a built in AA system giving it an additional layer of survivability. As an export model, universality is the first design criterion, and the simple maintenance requirements and slightly larger tonnage than a normal destroyer make it exceptionally popular in the fringes of the Sector. Excellent in single-ship and skirmish situations, but the relatively standard subsystems limits the its overall potential.",,,;
aEP_LiAnLiu,SHIP,"The company's general purpose high-speed destroyer, with three back-mounted turrets on the centre line, provides this warship with a wide range of firepower options. Not only that, but the ship's level of protection has not been sacrificed too much, making it suitable for a wide range of cruising missions, always on the front line of the Company's conflicts, and a staple export model. Despite the limited dispersion, the tactical system allows for a good amount of firepower at short notice by dropping shields.",,,;
aEP_CengLiu,SHIP,"A heavy destroyer providing fire support. Fitting the weapon re-invigoration system to medium to large ships is a difficult process, as the larger the ship is the more pressure it puts on the buffer zone, thus requiring a significant portion of the core hull to be reinforced with bulkheads. This was all to boost the limited firepower boost; as such deploying a destroyer of this type required a fairly strict adherence to certain tactical regulations, rending it useless in untrained hands.",,,
aEP_YouJiYan,SHIP,"The Organic Salt series represents the Company's excellent armoured freighter/tanker options, fitted with armour that would make most destroyers ashamed of themselves, and a flight deck to deal with the threat of high speed targets, but maintaining and deploying it is no less expensive than a proper military destroyer. There is never a shortage of people willing to put a premium on their cargo in the Sector, but in this era passive defence can only a delaying tactic, thus its real value lies in being able to eliminate 'accidents'. Any precision strike will have little effect on it unless it can defeat an entire escort fleet head on.",,,;

aEP_decomposer,SHIP,"One of the FSF's newest ship developments following the Collapse, the Decomposer-Class carried a significant amount of fuel and supplies, along with an open deck and dismantling system. It was designed to serve the needs of long-range fleets without supplies by dismantling the surviving wreckage of ships on the battlefield to recover needed parts and various consumables. For armies with less than stellar logistical systems, having this type of ship greatly reduces the pressure on logistics and allows an elite fleet to sustain itself for a considerable period of time in the event of a supply failure.
When a ship is shut down in battle, if the hull does not break apart on the spot, a significant part of its interior can be recovered. Normally, it is not until the battle is won or lost that one side is given the authority to clean up the battlefield, by which time many of the items in the wreckage that need to be kept airtight have drifted out into space in a fragmented manner and cannot be recovered. The Decomposer-class, which can conduct its salvage operations even on the battlefield, has a large exposed operations deck with a hole in the middle leading to the inner deck, where its supporting drones have built-in disintegration beams that can precisely break the wreckage into appropriately sized pieces to be carried back to the operations deck for recovery of usable items. To cater for undisturbed operations, the Decomposer has enough firepower to repel smaller ships, making a jack-of-all-trades sufficient to form the core of a small fleet.
Although the armour and structure are of military grade material, the Decomposer sacrifices the space of the shield generator in favour of a built in fleet of shield drones to protect against damage in order to meet the demands of both cargo and disassembly operations.

aEP_FanChongLi,SHIP,"The FSF has developed a frigate equivalent to the Brawler-Class Gunship, with a greater emphasis on defensive capabilities. Although the manoeuvrability, like that of the Brawler, is in the lower middle of the frigate class, the better width, the better shield effect and the unique recoil cannon give the Repulsor class the ability to disengage at any time, designed not to gain an advantage in battle, but to buy time for its own forces  as possible. For a frigate of this medium to large size, the slot design of the Repulsor class was very constrained, meaning that a trade-off had to be made between firepower and defensive power.
The recoil cannon built into the hull of the Repulsor class frigate is a unique tactical system for this ship, similar in principle to the door-breaking cone torpedoes produced by FSF, using a gravitational field generator to camouflage the mass of the projectile, the difference being that this camouflage occurs prior to firing and the ship uses an ultra-high powered electromagnetic chemical hybrid launcher to fire the projectile, already camouflaged as a high mass object, to obtain an equal amount of reaction force to push the the ship backwards rapidly. The gravitational field of the fired shell works at a much higher power than that of a normal breaching cone torpedo and is quickly damaged after launch, although this gives the same strong thrust to the target before the gravitational field inside the shell is completely disabled by a shell hit at close range.
",,,
aEP_XiLiu,SHIP,"A frigate designed according to a rather old layout. The four-way slot is more of a deterrent than anything else, it is the most conventional of the FSF frigates, although it lacks all the striking features that make the Hiryu class famous for its cheap firepower through its quantity of weapons. By streamlining the number of weapons to improve quality, the captain's piloting skills are made more demanding while also significantly raising the ship's performance ceiling.",,,
aEP_XiLiu_p,SHIP,"The Finestream class has been substantially rebuilt, with a large number of slots removed or modified, and is now a competent raider with a dangerous torpedo-firing capability, greater manoeuvrability and a small number of cargo holds fitted to carry her master's 'loot'.",,,
aEP_RaoLiu,SHIP,"Designed as a scout, the frigate is known for its low price and survival rate that does not match its price. The Recoil class is a frigate that combines high speed with a damping shell, with most of the spaces on the hull suitable for weapons being taken up by armour and damping equipment, making its slot utilisation awkward and its lack of firepower and over-protection making it one of the least popular frigates for pirates in the star realm.

At the cost of this, the direct impact of the projectile was not worth much against the heavy armour, and too much powder gas was ejected from the muzzle of the gun to form a cloud of smoke when fired. Although the smoke did not affect the performance of the fire control system in any way, it left a mark on the hull, which was much criticised by clean-loving captains.

aEP_flux_tube,WEAPON,这件武器是“事物是螺旋发展”的体现之一，早就脱离了需要自带散热剂时代的舰船，为了获得更好的幅散又捡起了这种直接通过物质载体进行排放的手段。形式上返璞归真但是实现起来比热能的处理麻烦的多，每一颗幅容管都是简化过的舰船幅容寄存器，而原来导弹槽供弹，瞄准等系统的空间则被改造用来从舰体导入幅能，也因为这个原因，其发射前需要一段时间的准备。,,,
aEP_harpoon_large,WEAPON,一种重型联装反护盾导弹，庞大的弹体中配备了大推力引擎，能以高质量高速度撞击目标，对中等程度装甲也造成威胁。会以高初速发射，且引擎全程加速，安装在舰船侧面可以划出弧线绕过目标的正面点防御,,,
aEP_CM_weapon,WEAPON,S-1型巡洋导弹是一种使用护卫舰舰体进行长距离飞行的特殊导弹，弹头引爆后内置的大量弹片被融化为等离子体向周围散射，高温足以熔化大部分装甲。,,,;

#小实弹/能量,,,,,
aEP_small_kinetic_beam,WEAPON,小型轻量化的冲击光束，低消耗，低装配，低伤害，但小槽足够的话能引起质变。,,,
aEP_forcus_laser,WEAPON,能缓慢熔化装甲的微波聚集器是公司小型舰船上常见的武器。虽然能量密度远不能和更先进的爆发性光束武器相比，但发射能量的总量极高。只要给与时间，就能如温水煮青蛙般将敌人的舰船煮熟,,,
aEP_pompom_small,WEAPON,这种低消耗的点防御武器以时常客串反舰武器而闻名，联装的中口径机炮能发射常规高爆装药而非靠破片杀伤，同时也将武器的射程推到反舰武器的级别,,,
aEP_vulcan,WEAPON,一种转管近防炮，能精准的将子弹打进同一个弹孔，但做出了牺牲的子弹威力和持续火力使之不善于迎击战机或是饱和攻击型导弹。,,,

#欧米茄武器,,,,,
aEP_railway_gun,WEAPON,"星域中可以安装在普通槽位上口径最大的火炮之一，作为公司“先进武器计划”的产物，能同时适配能量与实弹槽位。——""它在第一次破坏力测试时直接穿透了检测器的护盾，摧毁了其后的发生器和幅能压力检测器，所以我们暂时...没有数据""",-FSF先进武器计划科研员的定期汇报,,
aEP_long_barrel_chaingunAP,WEAPON,"在弹头中安置高密度微型电池完全带走了子弹的穿透力，但带来了对护盾稳定性的破坏。在击中护盾后向其注入能量如同在水面激起波纹，显著增加维持护盾的难度。——""放心，不会只因为失误把箱子摔到地上就把你电成糊的""",-FSF先进武器计划科研员的会议记录,,

aEP_defense_drone,SHIP,通用组盾无人机，大肆扩充了装甲，单纯为需要将甲板转换为正面战斗力的舰长而设计,,,;
aEP_repairing_drone,SHIP,分解者作为后勤舰的能力之一，应战场需求开发一种小型维修平台，用于在紧急状态下缓慢修复友军舰船的护甲，不能修复百分之50以上的部分和护卫舰。,,,
aEP_gunship_drone,SHIP,一种反战机设计的终极产物，配备数量众多且射界宽阔的机枪炮塔，使用EMP子弹瘫痪对手后，中间的光束主炮造成毁灭一击。这种对战机毫不留情的设计在飞行员中赢得了它的名声。尽管缺少持续性破甲能力和低速决定了对于反舰攻击非常尴尬。,,,
aEP_attacker_drone,SHIP,一种对舰攻击机，轻型框架给予其优秀的机动性，使用战舰级火炮对目标进行攻击。尽管总伤害可观，需要较长时间倾泻备弹且并不厚实的机体限制了它的发挥,,,
aEP_nuke_drone,SHIP,这种拥有厚重装甲和尾炮的战略轰炸机携带了一枚无动力反应炸弹，作为代价它飞的缓慢又迟钝。尽管有诸多缺点，反应炸弹不可阻挡的威力还是让它在摧毁固定目标上成为FSF最好的选择。,,,
aEP_anmian_drone,SHIP,原型是人之领某项无人机组盾测试项目失败处理设备时流出的单机样本，内置先进的幅能分流设备能将飞机护盾的压力转换到母舰上，FSF逆向工程后安装到了“暗面”级护卫舰中.比起原型加载了一个支援导弹发射系统，提供一点点火力支援。,,,
aEP_decompose_drone,SHIP,一种使用光束切割船体并回收补给的拆解无人机，使用了奢侈的360度护盾，在危险的战场上也能完成拆解作业。,,,
aEP_heavy_fighter,SHIP,携带一对大口径机炮的重型战斗机，破坏力足以撕开驱逐舰级别的舰体，同时也能通过战术系统进行爆发式推进以规避点防御火力，但较差的机动使之在战机间的较量中处于下风，通常只在已经取得制空权的战场上部署。,,,

#战机武器,,,,,
aEP_repairbeam_fighter,WEAPON,一种发射纳米材料激流的光束器，覆盖受损装甲后冷却固定，多用于战场紧急维修，无法将装甲修复到原本的强度,,,
aEP_tearing_beam_fighter,WEAPON,带有牵引力的切割光束，对完好的舰船几乎没有作用，但能快速切开已经损坏的残骸,,,
aEP_gunship_gun,WEAPON,发射带有emp的动能子弹，用于在空战中破开护盾并瘫痪对手,,,
aEP_gunship_cannon,WEAPON,一种高能光束发生器，在半秒内就能烧穿大部分战机的装甲。对于装备对舰武器的战机而言这并不是什么难事，可贵的地方在于作为专门为战机设计的武器，能以炮塔的形式安装,,,
aEP_attacker_drone_gun,WEAPON,一种战舰级火炮，搭载在飞机上不仅占用了原本用于防护的负载，备弹也十分有限,,,
aEP_defense_drone_gun,WEAPON,低消耗的机枪，用于战机点防御,,,
aEP_HL_drone_repairbeam,WEAPON,一种发射纳米材料激流的光束器，覆盖受损装甲后冷却固定，多用于战场紧急维修，无法将装甲修复到原本的强度。此款使用受舰船算法控制的武器还能精准定位母舰损坏的武器和引擎进行快速维修,,,
aEP_nuke_fighter,WEAPON,原子武器在星际时代并不是什么秘密，但将如此当量压缩到一颗空雷中就是另一个故事了，这颗反工事炸弹能摧毁最坚固的空间站和地面目标,,,
aEP_heavy_fighter_gun,WEAPON,这门机炮采用了高质量低初速的子弹，尽可能的增加弹头装药，这样做的代价是精度和有效射程的降低，在战机间对抗时难以命中,,,

#势力&&星系,,,,,
aEP_FSF,FACTION,"快速Fast.安全Safe.实用Functional aka FSF公司是大崩塌后成立的一家以销售军火，代工舰船为主要业务的军事企业，其成立要追溯到大崩溃前一个颇有能量的走私集团，与许多人之领的装备测试部队均有关系，以高价向各种企业出售人之领的原型机。随着星门的失效，集团的上层被困在了处于英仙座的秘密仓库中。深知手中的力量远不足以保护仓库中珍贵的货物的他们，依靠仓库中成山的物资彻底的从星域纠纷中消失，以地下组织的身份，成立了FSF前身。

在相当长的一段时间里，借着大崩溃初期的混乱，他们暗地中吸纳英仙座受到冲击的科学家进入组织，以求能量产复制当时FSF手中最先进的一批原型舰，但直到第一次AI战争前，都没有更多的消息。

在第一次AI战争后的黄金时期，边缘世界殖民地保卫战中零星出现的一些人们从未见过的外贸战舰象征着FSF作为今天被人所知的、提供包括舰船制造、军事指导、武器贸易的巨型企业出现在英仙座的舞台。尽管一直以来他们都以遵循人之领法律单纯的巨型企业的身份在英仙座中左右逢源，但近年来直线上升的舰队总量显示了他们的野心。",,,
aEP_FSF_Relay,CUSTOM,这颗通讯中继器的位置非常不正常，型号也不是英仙座常见的人之领遗留的类型，但从功率和清晰度来看必然是人之领的造物。这个星系原先并没有任何成型的工程，自然不会有人之领时期的中继器。FSF公司想必从别处（或者就是自己的仓库）拖拽过来固定在行星轨道上。,,,
aEP_FSF_SaleStation,CUSTOM,快捷Fast，安全Safe，实用Functional是FSF公司的全称。此处是FSF公司对外的商业中心，也是FSF早期设立的轨道设施。选在了一个资源匮乏而空洞的星系，在漫长的时日中伴随着公司不断壮大，现在这里除了是人来人往的商业中心也是一个武装到牙齿的星际要塞。,,,
aEP_FSF_DefStation,CUSTOM,FSF在星系中心新建造的军事基地，它的出现象征着公司政策的改变。尽管FSF在许多年前就有了足以自保的实力，但并未维持较大规模的军队。这座军事基地的完工意味着其向军事化组织转变的完成。,,,
aEP_FSF_Homestar,PLANET,一颗平平无奇的褐矮星，其暗淡的性质使得观测比较困难。除此以外，或许只有贫乏能形容这个系统了，缺少开发价值的行星，甚至连小行星带也没有，长久以来这个系统一直淡出人们的视野。,,,
aEP_FSF_Homeplanet,PLANET,如果这颗行星能再靠近一些的话，会成为拥有宜居温度的行星，可惜现在这里是长昼夜，永远覆盖冰雪的不毛之地，即使穿戴整齐的防护设备也无法在这里停留太久的时间，在设立长期居住地会消耗大量的资源，是相当不明智的行为。它最引人注目的地方是地表上的巨大设施和宏伟的入口。鉴于FSF在第一次AI战争之前尚未出现，其建于大崩溃之前还是之后尚未可知，但可以证实的是在第一次AI战争前就已经存在，并在之后逐渐废弃，主要功能转移到轨道空间站上。或许是随着公司业务的扩张，行星恶劣的气候已经成为一个越发严重的问题。,,,
aEP_FSF_Companyplanet,PLANET,一颗典型的荒芜行星，拥有一定价值的矿物，同时也因为过于靠近恒星而开采成本极高，FSF公司围绕其新建了一个军事基地，在靠近恒星的战场上，一座功能完备，能长期抵御恒星辐射的堡垒确实是一个难啃的目标，或许这能解释为什么FSF愿意在此花巨资。,,,
aEP_IND_Homestar,PLANET,这颗红矮星发出热量不足以支撑任何一颗星球达到适宜的温度，寒冷笼罩着这个星系。光线的昏暗让任何在这个星系的工作都困难重重，也带来了棘手的海盗问题,,,
aEP_IND_Homeplanet,PLANET,"大部分边缘星系殖民地的名字如今唯一被人所知的方式就是出现在某个科技挖掘工地上的指示牌上。在核心星区都为了资源打成一团的混乱时代中，这些无暇顾及的地方在十年，二十年后留下的只有死寂。

Lamdor X行星的气温常年低于大部分设备的工作极限，在失去能源供应的二到三年内就失去了大部分人口，唯独太空港所在的城市依靠能够运行数个世纪的反物质熔炉——和其他失去生机聚集地剩下的物资存活了下来，坚持到重新与核心星区建立了联系。

鉴于之前发生在这颗行星上的悲剧，""远亲不如近邻""成为了大部分届当地政府外交的原则，自早期就与FSF建立了非常深度的防御合作关系，尽管双方坚持对方的独立性，但人员和设备交换确实非常频繁。",,,

aEP_IND_Pirateplanet,PLANET,没有特点的荒芜星球，曾经有对其的开发计划但是很快就被搁置,,,
aEP_IND_Piratestation,CUSTOM,鉴于Lamdor X行星和核心星区的距离，袭击往来的运输舰队是一件非常有赚头的生计，名义上这里是一处驿站，但实际上海盗控制了这里用来监听往来的运输队——或者是带着战利品来这里享受生活,,,

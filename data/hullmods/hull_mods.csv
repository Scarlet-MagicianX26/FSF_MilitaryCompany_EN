Tugboat,aEP_Tugboat,0,FSF Design,,,,0,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.aEP_Tugboat,This ship can act as a tugboat. Increases the maximum speed of one of the slowest ships in the fleet to the same speed as this ship.,,graphics/hullmods/repair_gantry.png
Type-28 Shield Generator,aEP_Type28Shield,0,Unknown,,,,0,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.aEP_Type28Shield,"A logically miscalculated gamma core adds a separate shield generator module to the hull, with a module size almost equal to the size of the destroyer giving it excellent shield efficiency at the cost of flux upkeep. No shield hullmods can be installed atop this modification.",,graphics/aEP_hullmods/aEP_HL_multi_turret.png
Cruise Missile Carrier,aEP_CruiseMissileCarrier,0,FSF Design,,,,0,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.aEP_CruiseMissileCarrier,"Is able to launch S-1 Cruise Missiles in the cargo hold offensively, once they are loaded.",,graphics/aEP_hullmods/aEP_CM_carrier.png

Controlled Shield,aEP_ControledShield,1,FSF Design,,FSF,,20000,,,,6,12,18,30,data.hullmods.aEP_ControledShield,"The enhanced shield control system allows the targeting system to capture the trajectory of a long-range projectile, automatically its hardening the shields moments before impact. The larger the hull, the more distance is required for the system to function. For projectiles flying from {%s/%s/%s/%s} distance away, shields only take {%s} damage.",,graphics/aEP_hullmods/aEP_controled_shield.png
Hot-Autoloader System,aEP_HotLoader,1,FSF Design,,FSF,,20000,,,,3,5,7,10,data.hullmods.aEP_HotLoader,"FSF designed an advanced reloading system that efficiently recycles unused weapon energy for reloading efforts, which accelerates reloading by {%s} when weapon ammunition is low. However, this unique autoloader framwork is incompatible with Extended Magazines.",,graphics/aEP_hullmods/aEP_hot_loader.png
Advanced Flux Dissipation System,aEP_SoftfluxDissipate,1,FSF Design,,FSF,,10000,,,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.aEP_SoftfluxDissipate,"Equips the ship with a discharge system optimized for soft amplitude characteristics. At zero hard flux, the ship gains an additional {%s} flux per second for every flux vent installed, but the effect is reduced as the amount of hard flux rises, and is removed entirely at maximum hard flux.

No bonus is provided when the ship does not have shields or has had them disabled.",,graphics/aEP_hullmods/aEP_softflux_dissipate.png
"High Flux Register

At zero flux, the ship's flux dissipation decreases by {%s} for flux capacitor, but the effect is reversed as the flux level rises, and increases by the same amount at when reaching maximum flux.

Line Matrix Targeting,aEP_TargetSystem,1,FSF Design,,FSF,,10000,,,,4,5,9,12,data.hullmods.aEP_TargetSystem,"Installs a high performance ballistic radar to further increase weapon range, but the culmative stress on the grid reduces the efficiency of the shield system. Increases the ship's range by {%s/%s/%s/%s/%s} depending on the size of the ship, while shield efficiency is reduced.",,graphics/aEP_hullmods/aEP_target_system.png
Vanguard Hull,aEP_VanguardHull,1,FSF Design,,FSF,,15000,,,,8,12,18,22,data.hullmods.aEP_VanguardHull,"Reinforces the hull against repeated attacks from small caliber weaponry, although of less effectiveness against larger caliber weapons.

Anchor Shield,aEP_MaoDianShield,0,FSF Design,,,,0,,TRUE,TRUE,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.aEP_FighterSpecial,"Unique shield system which continously produces soft flux when deployed. However, when attacked, if the current soft flux is higher than hard flux, it will preferentially convert the soft flux into hard flux instead of generating hard flux.",,graphics/aEP_hullmods/aEP_vanguard_hull.png

#Conventional Built In Hullmods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FSF Hull Design,aEP_MarkerDissipation,0,FSF Design,,,,0,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.aEP_MarkerDissipation,"FSF hulls feature an internal open flux pipeline which allow for a large number of interfaces to allow for disruptive modifications to the ship and reduces the consequences of flux overload. When a ship produces soft flux in a short period of time, it enters a warm-up state, and remaining in the warm-up state generates additional flux gain based on the current hullmod. The amount of flux gained required to enter the warm-up state is determined by the capacity, and the rate at which the warm-up state fades is determined by the flux dispersion.",,graphics/aEP_hullmods/aEP_marker_dissipation.png
Missile Launch Platform,aEP_MissilePlatform,0,FSF Design,,,,0,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.aEP_MissilePlatform,"An advanced missile factory occupies most of the ship's hull, allowing it to produce a steady stream of high-quality missiles at the expense of launch speed and capacity.",,graphics/aEP_hullmods/aEP_missile_platform.png
Multi-turret Optimization,aEP_HLMultiTurret,0,FSF Design,,,,0,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.aEP_HLMultiTurret,"This ship has been built more efficiently in a way that allows it to withstand the weight of additional weapon mounts, and as such weapons mounted consume {%s/%s/%s} less OP for small, medium and large slots.",,graphics/aEP_hullmods/aEP_HL_multi_turret.png

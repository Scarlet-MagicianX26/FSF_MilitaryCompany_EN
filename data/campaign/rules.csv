Eventually you stop at some sort of conference room, where a presentation seems to have been held earlier, with a central holographic projection of a ship you can't identify floating in the asteroid belt, presumably some sort of self-replicating unmanned probe ship from the rough structural finish and the painted Domain of Man pattern.

The company then sent a medium sized combat fleet to recover the drone ship, and a firefight ensued.""

$heOrShe hands you the tablet and says: ""The results are on this report.

Sensing that $personFirstName means no harm, you smile back to hide your embarrassment.

""Simple question, firstly this is a very special drone ship and our Institute wants its data very badly, it is equally important to keep it out of the hands of other powers. Secondly, a medium battle fleet followed immediately by a large battle fleet heading towards the same place will be the talk of the star field no matter what they bring back. That's why this would be a lot more trouble for the company to do than for you to do it - no one is going to be watching where independent captains are flying all day, and it's better to let this ship be a secret than provoke a troublesome scuffle over it.""",,

According to the description in the previous engagement report, the ship's shields only began to show instability after taking several times the damage of a conventional ship's shield absorption limit, and the fleet's technical officer judged that with the current firepower strength to overload its shields the fleet would suffer greater losses.""
